# Nexus Core

**What is?**
ESX 1.2 Extended Version 

This version of the original kernel has been modified for the exclusive use of the servers **Nexus Life** *(closed*), **Goodlife RP** *(closed)*, **Aftermath AP**, **El Condado RP** and other servers of their same creators. 

Although this modification was private, the developers have chosen to release a (not final) version of a working kernel for certain purposes. We believe that the community does not value the work of developers very much, 
**always looking to steal the work of others**. To avoid this event again in our history, it has been launched, so that those who know what they are doing, can edit it, improve it and above all continue working on it, for those who want to make it stronger and more robust.


## Our history
We were born from the cave of wolves, looking to innovate, but without wasting time, we found ESX, specifically version 1.2, which to our liking, was the best that would help us to easily modify and implement. We build a server at our discretion, based on the criticism and opinions of our community, which by the way, we are developers from Chile, although the **main director of this project has been AlexBanPer in its entirety**. Although, we were not so well known in the world, we had our days of fame, although really everything is exhausted when small communities start dividing like cells exponentially and divide the same people, with 10, 20 or even 30 new servers every day.

Well, let's stop with sad stories that probably few will read and let's go with what matters.
